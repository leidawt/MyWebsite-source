	abstract = {TagSLAM provides a convenient, ﬂexible, and robust way of performing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with AprilTag ﬁducial markers. By leveraging a few simple abstractions (bodies, tags, cameras), TagSLAM provides a front end to the GTSAM factor graph optimizer that makes it possible to rapidly design a range of experiments that are based on tags: full SLAM, extrinsic camera calibration with non-overlapping views, visual localization for ground truth, loop closure for odometry, pose estimation etc. We discuss in detail how TagSLAM initializes the factor graph in a robust way, and present loop closure as an application example. TagSLAM is a ROS based open source package and can be found at https://berndpfrommer.github.io/tagslam\_web.},

	abstract = {Considering the growing demand of real-time motion planning in robot applications, this paper proposes a fast robot motion planner (FRMP) to plan collision-free and time-optimal trajectories, which applies the convex feasible set algorithm (CFS) to solve both the trajectory planning problem and the temporal optimization problem. The performance of CFS in trajectory planning is compared to the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) in simulation, which shows a signiﬁcant decrease in iteration numbers and computation time to converge a solution. The effectiveness of temporal optimization is shown on the operational time reduction in the experiment on FANUC LR Mate 200iD/7L.},
